### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm an avid coffee drinker, a lover of beautiful maps, a cat lady and Depeche Mode's biggest fan, depending on what day of the week you ask me. The last two are the only two that never change.

I started my career working in the environmental planning industry. Several years ago I taught a GIS course at my alma mater (it was harder than I thought it'd be). At some point I worked at [Weedmaps](https://weedmaps.com/) making awesome things happen through the power of geospatial data. I've worked in local government on projects ranging from data analysis, address dataset maintenance for dispatch and because 2020, I too have made Covid dashboards. After that I worked as a data engineer at [Near](https://near.com/) but after company-wide lay-offs, that came to an end. Most recently I work a [The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf](https://coffeebean.com/) where I use geospatial data to determine the best locations for new cafe openings.

I've been on this Launch School train for longer than I care to admit, but still not hopping off. This github profile is almost exclusively material I produce as a byproduct of completing Launch School coursework.
